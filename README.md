# Important Notes

the PPPwn here is actually just a fake one that is used to test args im too lazy to actually put the real one here download 

if you want it's going to have to be the C++ rewrite from xFangFang (https://github.com/xfangfang/PPPwn_cpp)

The source for the fake PPPwn can be found at https://github.com/interluded/fakePPPwn
